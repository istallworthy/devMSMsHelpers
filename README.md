# devMSMsHelpers
This repo provides a suite of helper functions for optional use with the <a href="https://github.com/istallworthy/devMSMs">*devMSMs* package</a>. These functions assist the user with formatting long (`formatLongData()`) and wide (`formatWideData()`) data, imputing data with missing values (`imputeData()`), and inspecting their data (`inspectData()`) prior to using *devMSMs*.  

Details on the implementation of these helper function can be found in the following <a href="https://github.com/istallworthy/devMSMs/blob/main/examplePipelineRevised.Rmd">Rmarkdown file</a>  and in the vignettes on the <a href="https://istallworthy.github.io/devMSMs/">*devMSMs* website</a>. A tutorial introduction the using marginal structural models can be found in the accompanying manuscript located here.
